# Smartendr Case

This is a simple project that fetches data from an API endpoint and displays it in several cards, each representing a table.

For each table, all orders have been combined to summarize the total amount of each item that has been ordered.
Items with different options or a different remark are considered different items.

The design of the dashboard has been derived from [this screenshot](https://assets.lightspeedhq.com/img/820358f8-addons_hospo_kitchendisplaysystem_halfwidth-1@2x-1024x717.png) as given to me as part of the assignment.
The representation of the amount of people served at a table, in the upper left corner, is a fixed number however, as the API does not provide this information.
Also the representation of the time of the order is randomly generated number between 0 and 9.

The design is made responsive to fit as much columns as possible on any screen size.

Lastly I added a small GitHub logo in the bottom right corner which links to the repository of this project.
